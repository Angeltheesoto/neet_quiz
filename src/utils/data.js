            options: [
              "'std::variant' is a C++17 feature that represents a type-safe union of types. It can hold values of different types, but only one value can be active at any given time. The 'std::variant' behaves like a discriminated union and provides a safe and type-checked way to handle multiple types. You can access the value stored in a 'std::variant' using 'std::visit' or 'std::get', and the compiler ensures that you handle all possible types correctly. On the other hand, 'std::any' is a container introduced in C++17 that can hold any type of value, similar to a type-erased container. Unlike 'std::variant', 'std::any' does not enforce type safety at compile time, and you need to use 'std::any_cast' to retrieve the stored value. Additionally, 'std::optional' is a container that holds an optional value of a specific type, representing the presence or absence of a value. Unlike 'std::variant', 'std::optional' can only hold values of a single type, but it provides a convenient way to handle optional values.",

Unlike 'std::string', which owns its underlying buffer and can be modified, 'std::string_view' does not own the data it points to and is read-only. It provides a lightweight way to access and manipulate substrings or portions of strings without copying the data. Since 'std::string_view' is just a view, you need to ensure that the underlying data remains valid during the lifetime of the view.

The 'std::transform' function takes four parameters: the beginning and ending iterators of the source range, the beginning iterator of the destination range, and the unary or binary function to be applied to the elements. For example, consider transforming a vector of integers to a vector of their squares:\ncpp\n#include <algorithm>\n#include <iostream>\n#include <vector>\n\nint square(int x) {\n return x * x;\n}\n\nint main() {\n std::vector<int> source = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\n std::vector<int> destination;\n destination.resize(source.size());\n std::transform(source.begin(), source.end(), destination.begin(), square);\n for (int value : destination) {\n std::cout << value << ' ';\n }\n return 0;\n}\n",
